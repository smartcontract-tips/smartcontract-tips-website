<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>ERC-4337 introduces an innovative framework within the Ethereum network, defined by several key components:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>UserOperations</strong>: This element is central to ERC-4337, functioning as quasi-transaction entities. They carry out tasks on behalf of users and are compiled in an alternate mempool, awaiting further processing.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>Bundlers</strong>: These entities manage the alternate mempool, combining various UserOperations into comprehensive operations, and then forwarding them to a specific contract.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>EntryPoint Contract</strong>: This contract acts as the receiver of bundled operations, handling their unpacking, validation, and execution.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>Paymaster Component</strong>: A novel addition in ERC-4337, the Paymaster handles the diversity in gas payment strategies, allowing varied methods of gas fee settlements.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>Aggregator Contract</strong>: Supporting the main smart contract account, this contract aids in simultaneously validating signatures of numerous UserOperations.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Together, these components are instrumental in realizing account abstraction and the concept of smart contract wallets within Ethereum.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Unraveling-ERC-4337-and-EIP-4337"><a href="https://hackmd.io/WN2Dh3bCSeS6cWbx6XTFbQ?view#Unraveling-ERC-4337-and-EIP-4337"></a>Unraveling ERC-4337 and EIP-4337</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Understanding the distinction between EIP-4337 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) and ERC-4337 (Ethereum Request for Comment) is pivotal in comprehending the full impact of this standard. While both play vital roles within the Ethereum ecosystem, their functions are distinct. EIP-4337 represents the preliminary phase of proposing technical modifications to the Ethereum network. This stage is all about the conceptualization and development of new ideas and their discussion within the community.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Conversely, ERC-4337 steps into the limelight once an EIP receives approval and is poised for wider implementation and standardization. ERCs define the standards and protocols for the Ethereum network, directing developers on how to uniformly and effectively implement the proposed modifications. The progression from EIP-4337 to ERC-4337 marks a significant transition from a proposal to an established and recognized standard, signaling its acceptance and readiness for deployment across the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The journey of EIP-4337, short for Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4337, is integral to the story of ERC-4337. Initiated as a groundbreaking technical proposition in 2021 under the guidance of Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin and a team of leading developers, EIP-4337 laid the groundwork for what would eventually become ERC-4337. This proposal received the green light through Ethereum’s unique on-chain governance process, culminating in its approval in March 2023.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While EIP-4337 and its successor ERC-4337 are often in the spotlight, the Ethereum Improvement Proposal landscape includes other notable initiatives aiming at account abstraction:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>EIP-2771</strong>: This proposal brings forth the concept of “meta-transactions,” which allows third parties to shoulder gas fees for users. It enhances user experience by offering a more inclusive approach without necessitating any changes to the core Ethereum protocol.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>EIP-2938</strong>: Offering a contrast to ERC-4337, this proposal advocates for a protocol update in Ethereum with a new transaction type, AA_TX_TYPE, dedicated to providing inherent support for smart contract wallets.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>EIP-3074</strong>: This proposal’s ambition is to give Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) the ability to delegate authority to smart contracts, which would require the introduction of two new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) opcodes: AUTH and AUTHCALL.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Despite the existence of these alternatives, the Ethereum community has shown a strong inclination towards EIP-4337 and ERC-4337, primarily due to their minimally invasive nature towards the existing Ethereum protocol.</p>
